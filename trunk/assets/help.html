<b>Q:</b> How do I launch SpeakerBoost when I am in another application?<br/>
<b>A:</b> On Kindle Fire, you can tap on the left part of the status bar to pull down the notifications and then tap on "SpeakerBoost".  In many

 swipe down from the notification bar or hold the SEARCH button.<br/><br/>
