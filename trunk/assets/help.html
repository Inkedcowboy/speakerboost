<b>Q:</b> What's this business with danger to the speakers?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Overdriving small speakers can damage or destroy them.
 Keeping the boost to 30%-40% or lower should help, but it is not
 possible to test this app on all devices, and YOU ARE USING IT AT
 YOUR OWN RISK.  If you get screechy sound, lower the boost immediately.<br/><br/>
<b>Q:</b> How do I launch Speaker Boost when I am in another application?<br/>
<b>A:</b> On Kindle Fire, you can tap on the left part of the status bar to pull down the notifications and then tap on "SpeakerBoost".  In many
 apps the statusbar can be shown by tapping anywhere on the screen.  On other devices, you can
 swipe down from the notification bar or hold the SEARCH button.<br/><br/>
<b>Q:</b> Could I get a volume adjustment bar beside the boost bar?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Yes: just press the tools icon in Speaker Boost, tap on Settings, and there will be an option you can put a checkmark beside.<br/><br/>
<b>Q:</b> Is source code available?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Yes, at <b>http://code.google.com/p/speakerboost</b><br/><br/>
